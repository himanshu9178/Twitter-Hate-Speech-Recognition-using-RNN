# Introduction
### This repository is dedicated to the research and development of hate speech recognition models focused on Twitter data. With the rise of social media platforms, it's more important than ever to ensure online interactions remain respectful and constructive. This project aims to tackle one of the pressing challenges of our digital age: identifying and addressing hate speech on Twitter.
# Dataset
## Twitter Hate Speech Dataset
### This dataset has been curated from millions of tweets, filtering out those that contain potentially harmful or offensive content.
### Features
### 1.tweet_id: Unique identifier for the tweet.
### 2.user_id: Unique identifier for the user who posted the tweet.
### 3.tweet_text: Text content of the tweet.
### 4.label: Classification label (0 for non-hate speech, 1 for hate speech).
## Dataset Source: Labled_data
# Project Importance
### Safer Online Environments: By effectively recognizing hate speech, platforms can become safer and more inclusive for users.
### Automated Moderation: Manual moderation can be resource-intensive. An effective hate speech recognition model can assist in automated content moderation.
### Research & Development: Understanding patterns in hate speech can lead to more advanced research in linguistics, psychology, and sociocultural studies.
### Policy & Regulation: As governments worldwide strive to regulate online content, this project can serve as a benchmark and aid in policy-making decisions.
